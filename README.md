# SimpleMP4Player.

This script will run a simple MP4 player. This player however, doesn't have any buttons.

Whether it's Play, Pause or Stop button. Just a window with a player in it.

Perfect for shady stuffs.

## Installation

This script requires OpenCV and FFPyPlayer in order to run properly.

Just use the package manager (or you call them, [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)) to install the modules.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install ffpyplayer
```

## Usage
Pretty simple, to be honest. Just replace the sample.mp4 with the video you want to play,

or just have fun with the source code and try make something out of it.
```python
python MoviePlayer.py
```
